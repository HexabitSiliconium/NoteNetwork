# NoteNetwork

_The World's Largest Notebook_

This service lets students upload their class notes and look at the notes of other students. This service can help students who might miss a class or might not understand something. For students who might miss a class, this service would let that student look at a classmate’s notes and get a better insight into what was discussed. For students who don’t understand something, maybe looking at another person’s notes or even looking at another student from a different professor might help them understand better.
To make sure the exchange is fair, in order for a user to look at another person’s notes, that user must upload their own notes first. Some sort of curation system would need to be put in place to make sure people aren’t just putting up junk. Further details can be hammered out if this idea is chosen.
